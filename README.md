# PicoRico
An open source telemetry system using downhill mountain biking as an inspiration. 

#Problem:

Modern downhill bikes have a lot of adjustability but their performance is hard to measure. If there was a system to collect data it would be easy to make adjustments with a scientific approach. Riders could also get feedback on their riding style and line choices. It could also add to the entertainment side of things by providing realtime telemetry for spectators. 

#Possible Telemetry:
   * suspension compression rates
   * suspension rebound rates
   * wheel speed
   * when brakes are applied 
   * gear selection
   * crank rotation
   * handbar direction
   * wheel deflection
   * tire pressure

#Problems:
   * high velocities
   * hi duty cycles
   * hostile environment - cold/wet/dust/mud/heat
   * needs to support quick mounting/unmounting
   * frequent vibrations
   * large sudden impacts
